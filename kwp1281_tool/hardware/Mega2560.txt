Connection radio->MC33660->Arduino Mega2560:

12V to power radio
GND is common for radio,MC33660 and Arduino(so also computer over USB)
K-line to radio K-line pin
K-line over 510Ohm(2x1kOhm in parallel) to 12V

12V to pin 1 of MC33660
GND to pin 3 of MC33660
K-line to pin 4 of MC33660
Arduino TX1 to pin 5 of MC33660
Arduino RX1 to pin 6 of MC33660
Arduino 5V to pin 7 of MC33660
Arduino 5V to pin 8 of MC33660
